The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 is affecting our planet.  The main objective of this project is tounderstand  and  use  various  mathematical  tools  for  modeling  and  predicting  the  number  of  infected  anddeceased people during the pandemic.  For this purpose, we study some of the most important aspects inrelation  to  the  disease  and  the  epidemic.  We  use  tools  such  as  three  well-known  epidemiological  models, the  grid  search  algorithm  and  seasonal  autoregressive  integrated  moving  average  models.   Moreover, we contrast the theorical data obtained with real data from Catalunya.
